Awesome project. Here’s a clean, language-agnostic path you can follow to build a console/ASCII Tic-Tac-Toe. Each stage is small, testable, and you can stop any time and still have something that runs.

# Stage-by-stage plan (with checkpoints)

1. Skeleton + loop
   **Goal:** Program starts, shows a title, exits cleanly.
   **Do:** Create `main()` with a simple menu: “1) Play  2) Quit”. Stub `play_game()`.
   **Done when:** You can choose Quit and the program ends.

2. Board representation
   **Goal:** Decide how to store the board.
   **Do:** Use a 9-element list/array of `' '`, or a 3×3 matrix. Keep constants: `X='X'`, `O='O'`.
   **Done when:** You can create/clear a board.

3. ASCII renderer
   **Goal:** Print a readable board with coordinates.
   **Do:** Write `draw(board)` that prints:

```
   1   2   3
A  X | O |  
  ---+---+---
B    | X |  
  ---+---+---
C    | O | X
```

(or 1–9 cell numbers).
**Done when:** Calling `draw()` on any board state looks right.

4. Input & parsing
   **Goal:** Read a move, validate it.
   **Do:** Accept formats you like (“A1”, “b3”, or “1–9”). Normalize to an index 0–8.
   Check: in-range, cell empty; give friendly error and reprompt.
   **Done when:** Illegal inputs don’t crash; valid ones return an index.

5. Apply move + turn switching
   **Goal:** Place a mark and pass the turn.
   **Do:** `apply_move(board, idx, player)` sets `'X'`/`'O'`. Toggle current player.
   **Done when:** Two humans can alternate placing marks (no win logic yet).

6. Win detection
   **Goal:** Know when someone wins.
   **Do:** Predefine winning lines:

```
WIN_LINES = [
  (0,1,2),(3,4,5),(6,7,8),   # rows
  (0,3,6),(1,4,7),(2,5,8),   # cols
  (0,4,8),(2,4,6)            # diagonals
]
```

`winner(board)` returns `'X'`, `'O'`, or `None`.
**Done when:** Manually set boards that should be wins and your function detects them.

7. Draw detection
   **Goal:** End stalemates.
   **Do:** `is_draw(board)` = no spaces left and `winner` is `None`.
   **Done when:** A filled non-winning board ends as “Draw”.

8. Full game loop
   **Goal:** Play a complete round end-to-end.
   **Do:** In `play_game()`:

* set `player='X'`
* loop: draw → read input → if valid apply → check `winner`/`draw` → switch.
  At end, announce result and return to menu.
  **Done when:** You can play a full human-vs-human game.

9. Replay & quality of life
   **Goal:** Smooth UX.
   **Do:** After a game, prompt “Play again (y/n)?”. Add “q” to quit during a move.
   **Done when:** You can play multiple rounds without restarting the program.

10. Simple CPU (optional)
    **Goal:** Single-player mode.
    **Do (in order of simplicity):**

* **Random AI:** pick any empty cell.
* **Rule-based AI:** if you can win this turn → do it; else if opponent can win next turn → block; else center → corner → side.
* **Minimax AI:** full game tree with scores (+1 win / 0 draw / −1 loss). Add depth caps or randomness for difficulty.
  **Done when:** You can select Human vs CPU (easy/normal/hard).

11. Tests (lightweight)
    **Goal:** Stop regressions.
    **Do:** Add tiny unit checks for `winner()` and `is_draw()` using hard-coded boards:

* X row win, O column win, diagonal win, draw board, in-progress board.
  **Done when:** Running tests prints “OK” before starting the game.

12. Polish & extras (pick any)

* Move history & “undo”.
* Input shortcuts (1–9 mapping).
* Scoreboard (wins/losses/draws).
* Save/restore last match.
* ANSI colors for X/O.
* 4×4 or 5×5 variant (update `WIN_LINES` generator).

## Minimal pseudocode you can drop into any scripting language

```text
function main():
    while true:
        choice = menu()
        if choice == "play":
            play_game()
        else if choice == "quit":
            return

function play_game(mode="HUMAN_VS_HUMAN"):
    board = [' ']*9
    player = 'X'
    while true:
        draw(board)
        if mode == "HUMAN_VS_CPU" and player == 'O':
            idx = cpu_move(board)               # start with random empty
        else:
            idx = read_move(board)              # parse & validate
        board[idx] = player

        w = winner(board)
        if w != None:
            draw(board); print(w, "wins!"); break
        if is_draw(board):
            draw(board); print("Draw!"); break

        player = ('O' if player=='X' else 'X')

function winner(board):
    for (a,b,c) in WIN_LINES:
        if board[a] != ' ' and board[a]==board[b]==board[c]:
            return board[a]
    return None

function is_draw(board):
    return (winner(board) == None) and (' ' not in board)
```

### Quick ASCII mapping (if you want 1–9 keys)

```
1 | 2 | 3
--+---+--
4 | 5 | 6
--+---+--
7 | 8 | 9
```

Index = key−1.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

* Forgetting to re-draw the board after each move (players feel “lost”).
* Accepting moves into occupied cells (validate before apply).
* Mis-indexing win lines (test each line!).
* Infinite loops on bad input (always reprompt).
